                                <p> Hello, and thank you for visiting my website. I have a bachelors degree in Psychology from
                                    Keene State and have worked in medical devices for the past six years. I'm currently
                                    enrolled in a coding bootcamp through the University of New Hampshire. I am here to change
                                    my career and my life! </p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-12">
                                <p> Since I was a kid I've had a knack for computers, starting my journey on DOS. I've found
                                    myself as the go to "troubleshooter" for my respective teams during my work experiences.
                                    Can't get your computer to turn on/off? Ask Jess. SAP is giving a strange error message?
                                    Ask Jess. We need someone to help with validation? Ask Jess. </p>

                                <br>

                                <p>This apptitude for computers continued to grow and, at the recommendation of a friend, I
                                    decided to give coding a try. I was surprised to find that coding really was just like
                                    the games and puzzles I love to solve. Now, instead of having an indescribable intuition
                                    about what to do, I can actually create, edit and design my own content (and understand
                                    how and why!). I'm learning the language to go with the instinct, and I am loving it!</p>
